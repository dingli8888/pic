> üß∏‚ùóÔ∏è This is a small practice project I wrote to learn React. Looking at the code now, it's quite messy and only functional. Don't refer to the code logic. I don't have time to optimize it now, but if anyone with the ability can make the code prettier, feel free to submit a merge request.

## Getting Started

**Step 1:**

config Unsplash key

üí° create file `.env.local`, put in your unsplash key 
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_API_KEY = your_unsplash_api_key
```
Refer: [https://unsplash.com/documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation)


**Step 2:**

Run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy Static

Run
 ```bash
npm run build
 ```
static file generate to `out` dir
